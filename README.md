# e-Commerce_Web_ASP.NET
 This project includes a simple version of an e-commerce site.
 
 ### 1. INTRODUCTION
 
In this project, I developed a game on the web. The name of our game is "Hangman". The general rule of our game is to send letters in order within 30 seconds to correctly guess a given word. Our game offers the user to guess the words by pulling the words from a virtual database previously saved in XML format. If the user wishes, he can enter a new word and a hint of this word into the virtual database.

 ### 2. DESIGN

I used HTML, CSS and ASP.NET components in the design part.
